Version 2.0.2 [stable]
======================

This is a maintenance release of gElemental which includes an updated Russian
translation, forces button colours for new Yaru themes in Ubuntu 22.04 and
fixes building with Pango 1.50.

Version 2.0.1 [stable]
======================

This is a maintenance release of gElemental which is C++17 compatible and
forces button colours for several modern themes.

Version 2.0.0 [stable]
----------------------

This release of gElemental reflects the transfer to a new maintainer.
It includes several bugfixes from the Debichem Team, some minor interface
improvements, and the addition of new element names.

Version 1.2.0 [stable]
----------------------

This is a major feature release of gElemental. The program is now licensed under
the GNU GPL version 3 or later; see COPYING for details. The table view now
supports colouring by most properties, and displays property values. An issue
with button colours under some GTK+ themes has been resolved. Several minor
interface improvements have been made.

libgelemental has been renamed to libelemental, and an API break has been made
to address several issues. Colour handling has been improved, and scale
calculation support has been added for floating-point properties. EntriesStream,
an EntriesView adapter for output streams and files, has been added. Lattice
volumes are now expressed in nanometres. Documentation has been improved.

The pygElemental Python binding has been renamed to pyElemental; see its NEWS
file for details.

Version 1.0.0 [stable]
----------------------

This is the first stable release of gElemental. It includes minor interface
and internal improvements.

Version 0.10.1 [prerelease]
---------------------------

This is a minor feature release of the gElemental prerelease series. Ambrogio
Oliva has completed the Italian translation and suggested several corrections.
Marion Petersen has contributed a complete German translation. Responsiveness
has been improved in the table view.

Version 0.10.0 [prerelease]
---------------------------

This is a major feature release of the gElemental prerelease series. Many of the
data from the Blue Obelisk Data Repository have been integrated, updating and
expanding the existing set. New properties include periodic table blocks,
van der Waals radii, electron affinities, and identifying colours. The
crystallography properties have been replaced with an expanded set.

The table view can now also be coloured by block, lattice type, and element. It
displays more identifying information when hovering over an element. The list
view can now display and be sorted by any of the properties. The element dialog
has been reorganised into three tabs. A new help dialog describes the properties
and their sources.

A new internal system of properties has been introduced which streamlines the
code and libgelemental's API. libgelemental's dependencies have been reduced to
glibmm (>= 2.6) and cairo. pygElemental is now distributed separately.

A new SVG-based Tango-style icon is now used, and Tango-style colours are now
used for table colouring. Many minor changes have been made.

Version 0.9.3 [unstable]
------------------------

This is a minor feature release of the gElemental unstable series. It introduces
the (experimental, but complete) pygElemental Python binding; configure with
--enable-python to get it. Ambrogio Oliva has expanded the Italian translation
and suggested improvements to naming of chemical series.

Version 0.9.2 [unstable]
------------------------

This is a maintenance release of the gElemental unstable series. It reintroduces
additional translations from the GPeriodic 1.x series. These translations (de,
es, it, nl, pt, ru) are currently skeletal. Also, window size is now preserved
between uses of the list view.

Version 0.9.1 [unstable]
------------------------

This is a maintenance release of the gElemental unstable series. It fixes issues
with recent versions of GLib, GTK+ and autoconf, and an issue involving encoding
of translated strings.

Version 0.9.0 [unstable]
------------------------

This is the first release version of gElemental, and is an unstable release for
testing and translation. gElemental is derived from GPeriodic version 2.0.8. The
following major changes have been made:

* Element data updated, expanded, and reconfirmed against sources, including
	recently named or discovered elements Ds, Rg, Uut, Uup, Uuh, and Uuo.
* Translation methodology improved and translations expanded.

* New list view displays key information in a sortable list.
* Redesigned element properties dialog categorises information.
* Colouring by phase at a specified temperature now available in interface.
* Element colouring now preserves GTK+ theme appearance. Colour legend added.

* Code base ported to C++ and gtkmm.
* Element and table data split out into libgelemental.
* Element data stored with appropriate typing.
