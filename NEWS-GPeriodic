2.0.3 Wed Mar 29 14:24:00 CET 2003
   Piotr Najman <picio@bogucice.pl> has provided a patch that added
   "Appearance" and location to element data. The patch
   also modify dump table function (print all data).
   Made some non-intrusive changes to the code to allow for translations 
   with gettext.
   Fixed some segmentation faults when inputting nonexistent elements
   at the command line.

   Minor cleanup of about window.

2.0.1 Wed Mar 05 11:26:39 CET 2003
   Piotr Najman <picio@bogucice.pl> has provided a patch  
   that added the following data points to the table:
      . Discovery date
      . Discovered by
      . Named after
   and added the code necessary to access the data.

2.0.0
   Port to GTK+ 2, major rewrite and reconfiguring of the code. Removed some
   parts which seem to be unnecessary.

1.3.3 Fri Jan 18 10:34:38 EST 2002
   Applied a patch from Jonas Frantz <frantz@beam.helsinki.fi> that
   added lattice structure and lattice constants.  The patch also
   added some atom radii which were not present in previous versions.

1.3.2 Mon Aug 27 22:58:25 EDT 2001
   Fixed bug in cmdline_interface.c(90), it was causing core dump when
   printing an element.


1.3.0 Thu Apr  5 00:04:13 EDT 2001
   Michael Shigorin <mike@lic145.kiev.ua> has provided a ru.po to translate
        the application into Russian.

   I've started on a new data access/storage scheme.  I want to abstract
        the data away from the interface as much as possible.  My first steps 
        towards this end was to allow the internal table to be dumped
        and make it possible to load the table from an external file.
        That lead me into building a command line interface.  So far, 
        the dump functionality is working, as well as an interactive
        shell like environment (complete with readline support - even
        history).  I also extended the command line interface to support 
        the dumping of specific element information, as well as being 
        able to run interactive commands solely from the command line.

   That basically makes this our first development release.  I'm going to start
        from here with the convention that an odd minor version number
        indicates a development version, while an even minor version 
        indicates a stable version.  

        major.minor.revision

        Revision numbers will increment as releases are made for bug fixes
        or minor changes in the application.  Minor numbers will increment
        as new features are added.  Major will increment as large portions
        change internally [like when the new data access scheme is 
        complete]. So the 1.3 series should result in a 2.0 application.

1.2.6a Wed Apr  4 13:50:46 EDT 2001
   Felix Natter <f.natter@ndh.net> pointed out the fact that po/Makefile.in
        was specified in the configure script was incorrect, and should 
        have been po/Makefile.  This release corrects that build issue.
   Newer versions of gettext seem to make use of the environment variable
        LANGUAGE instead of LANG.  I've added some documentation to the 
        README for using gperiodic in these environments.

1.2.6 Wed Sep  8 09:11:26 EDT 1999
  Ambrogio Oliva <Ambrogio.Oliva@sanofi-synthelabo.fr> has provided
	an it.po file, giving us a new translation - Italian.  I made some
	changes to the build process, adding in tests for each of the
	languages into Makefile.am (though you need to have to have installed
	before the tests work -- I don't know how to get gettext to look
	in the po directory instead of the installed lang directory), and
	a 'make distrib' to build a source distribution.

1.2.5 Thu Jul 29 11:02:48 EDT 1999
  Thanks to Koen Kooi <koen_kooi@hotmail.com> we now have support for
	Dutch.

1.2.4 Fri Jul 16 09:10:13 EDT 1999
  New German changes from Christian Klein <chris@koeln.ccc.de>.
  Christian -- Every time I try to reply to your email, it bounces
  back.  Do I have a valid address for you?

  Frederic Gobry <gobry@idiap.ch> suggested changing asprintf() to
  g_strdup_printf() to increase portability.

  Martin Willemoes Hansen <mwh@stampede.org> wrote in to say that
  GPeriodic 1.2.0 will now be part of the Stampede distribution.
    http://www.stampede.org

  Added version to Makefile.am, and to the about dialog box...

1.2.3 Thu Jul 15 13:54:39 EDT 1999
  Sven Neumann <neumanns@uni-duesseldorf.de> has provided a full
  translation for German.  This affects only the de.po file.

1.2.1 Tue Jul 13 12:04:36 EDT 1999
  Added color values to the table_entry structure, and the related
  code to set the colors of the buttons -- also added the RGB data to
  the table_data.c file.

1.2.0 Mon Jul 12 11:53:32 EDT 1999
  Integrated changes from Arno Peters <A.W.Peters@ieee.org> - includes
  use of automake.  Changed sources to remove all the c++ constructs, 
  making gperiodic pure c.  Integrated gettext to add (proper) support for 
  internationalization.  Removed the command line switches...which are no
  longer needed as gettext should detect the locale and display the 
  proper language based on it.

1.1.1 Fri Jul  2 13:40:08 EDT 1999
  Created initial man page.

  Added checks to the configure script for Perl, and GTK+ version 1.2.1
  may not be necessary, but it's the version I used for development,
  so that's all I have to go on.

  Cleaned up the src/Makefile -- it now uses a pattern rule to produce
  the static table data.  This included updating the create_table.pl script 
  to detect the language string (en/fr/etc) from the file name.

  Updated the top level makefile so it can do an install -- it only
  installs to /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/man for now.

1.1.0 Wed Jun 30 16:45:30 EDT 1999
  Wow!  This thing is getting translated fast.
  Lalo Martins <lalo@webcom.com> - just sent me a Portuguese translation
  for the strings table.  This give the menus and messages a translation,
  but not the element table data -- that is supposed to be coming.

  This brings the software to this state concerning translation:
    Language    Strings        Table
     English     Yes            Yes
     French      Yes            Yes
     Spanish     Yes            Yes
     German      No             Yes
     Portuguese  Yes            No

1.0.7 Wed Jun 30 09:57:42 EDT 1999
  Changes from Georges Khaznadar <khazuada@univ-littoral.fr>,
  that include a translation of the format sting for the tooltips
  (abbreviations were in English, now they can be translated),
  and French language corrections.

  German is now on the list of supported languages -- this translation
  is so far only for the table data, I'm trying to contact the person
  who sent me the translation, but the mail keeps bouncing back.
  If anyone knows this person, or can give me more information, I'd 
  appreciate it:  Christian Klein <chris@koeln.ccc.de>

1.0.6 Tue Jun 29 13:43:05 EDT 1999
  Mauricio Rivera <rmrivera@hotmail.com> -- provided a translation
    to Spanish.  Use -l es to have GPeriodic appear in Spanish.

1.0.5 Thu Jun 24 13:09:52 EDT 1999
  Georges Khaznadar <khazuada@univ-littoral.fr> -- provided translation
    for a French adaptation!  and the code has been added in...

1.0.4 Thu Jun 24 10:09:42 EDT 1999
  Migrated the element data structure to a C++ object, this should fix
    some of the crashes some people have been experiencing.
  Jean Meloche <jean@stat.ubc.ca> -- pointed out some bug fixes, should be
    fixed by the move to the C++ object.
  Jon Abbott <muaddib@magicnet.net> -- table data fix(es).
  Andrew Dalke <dalke@bioreason.com> -- provided new data (Pauling 
    negativity numbers)

1.0.3
  Added more information to the table, as provided by:
    jon abbott <muaddib@magicnet.net>

1.0.2 Sat Jun  5 14:02:07 EDT 1999
  Changed the tooltips around a little bit, and enabled the -t 
  command line option to read directly from the text file instead
  of the internal table...so you can choose either at runtime.

1.0.1 Fri Jun  4 10:19:26 EDT 1999
  I was contacted by Andrew Dalke <dalke@bioreason.com> shortly after
    posting GPeriodic to the Internet, and he graciously pointed out 
    an extensive list of inconsistencies in the data I was using for 
    the table.  I've made these changes to the table, so it should
    be quite a bit more up to date.

  I also made the attempt at using autoconf, though I don't think I'm
    using it as well as I could be...
